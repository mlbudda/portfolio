## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was simple and yet tricky enough to underestimate the time to complete. The design looks simple, but it has overflow and layers of the 3 background images. Everything has to keep centered positions and align with the text on the right.
