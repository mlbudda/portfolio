## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS min()
- Responsive paddings/margins
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge, I focused on responsive layout, margins, and paddings. My biggest issue was adding two layers on top of an image on the hover pseudo-class.
I solved this issue by using absolute positioning. This allowed me to layer the image and keep it responsive on any screen size. I also added a slight transition effect to make the design more visually appealing. Finally, I adjusted the margins and paddings to ensure that the design was aesthetically pleasing and that it displayed correctly on all devices.
