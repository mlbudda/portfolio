## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The most challenging part was laying out for different resolutions. The main goal was to keep media queries as concise as possible, so all padding, margins and some container widths were kept responsive with minimum and maximum implementation.
